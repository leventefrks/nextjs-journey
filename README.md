My company is about to switch from Vue.js to React / Next.js so I'm jumping into a new world and trying out this hip framework.
This is nothing more but hopefully an exciting journey and a step by step tutorial mainly based on
[PedroTech's React course](https://www.youtube.com/c/PedroTechnologies) sprinkled with my favourite CSS framework TailwindCSS.

i'm pretty excited.
